This example is for MOLARIS package.  The data can be generated by any MD simulation program.

Make sure that the binding site is well defined and the seed protein structures with different drug ligands
should be superimposed.

In this example, the mutations are automatically genearted then the structures are minimized by steepest descent. 
Then, the electrostatics are recorded for 5ps relaxation.
