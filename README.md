### Introduction
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that causes Immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  After its first clinical discovery in 1981, it has threatened a large number of the population in the world and more than 30 million people have been infected. Scientists have been doing a lot of research to fight the virus and it is still an active field of research since we still do not have medicine advanced enough to completely cure the disease .

The reason why HIV is a dangerous and challenging problem unlike other viruses is due to its ability to develop drug resistance. Once a person is infected, the virus replicates itself in the body with a huge number of variation in the genome which is also called as mutation. Even though there are many clinically available medicines that are effective at first, HIV quickly generates millions of mutants. Among these mutants, some of them become resistant to the dose of medicines and the viruses become active in our body again.
